## Task
使用下面句型中至少6个以上的句型，写一段话，并录音，将文章和语音发到群里打卡。

**Today, I am introducing** three apps that I used most frequently.  
**The first one is** Evernote. **This is** a great note-taking app. It ~~have~~has a powerful search function. It can even search text inside images or files. Sometimes we save a lot of paper files, **what we wanna do is to** find things easily when we want it. **The problem is that** they are hard to manage and search. Actually, you can upload these files to Evernote using your camera, and Evernote will do it for you.   
**The second is** Pocket. It can save the things you want to view later easily. You may be wondering, **why do we need** an app to do these kind of things for us? That's because Pocket can read the articles for you to listen. When you don't have time to read, you can just put on your earphones, and listen to your favorite articles, when you are walking, when you are boring, anytime you want. Isn't that cool?  
**And the third is** Expressxxx.  There are many sites providing great resources to us, for example, Google, Youtube, Twitter...**The problem with them is** these sites can't be reached in China. With Expressxxx, you can connect to these site stable and fast. **So if you** wanna enjoy high definition video ~~in~~on Youtube, Expressxxx is a nice choice.  
**So, three apps** make your life better. What are your favorite apps? Could you share them with us?
